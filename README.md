# PRODIGY_CS_05
A python project for a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.
First, install scapy
Save the script to a file, for example, packet_sniffer.py, and run it with administrative privileges (since sniffing network traffic usually requires elevated permissions).
Adjust the port number and payload filtering as needed for other protocols.
